        <p>Studying takes alot of time, especially when you are really ambitious or when you need alot of time to work on all your things. But we need to remember to take breakes and treat ourselves with things we like to do. And not just study 100% of the time. I have felt quite burned out recently, being so close but still not at the end of this term is very exhausting for many people. Yesterday I needed to study for a biologytest but my body physically refused! It felt like my body just stopped and couldn't do anything for several hours... But even if that sounds horrible, I really needed that, just a stop to recharge my brain for today because after having only assignments and test on your brain for so many months. You really need it, and I believe everyone really should do the same! </p>
