Werther you need help with your lack of motivation, or maybe you don't know how to study for a specific subject effectively. I have personally been there many times where everything just doesn't work out the way you want. One giant goal for this very unknown website might be to build a community where any student can go for any help they might need. Sometimes you just need somebody to relate with about different things. But anyway! Hope you like this little website I have made</p>
