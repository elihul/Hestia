     <p>This page is here for anyone to visit who sometimes feel like they need help with studying. Whether you need help with your lack of motivation, or maybe you don't know how to study for a specific subject effectively. I have personally been there many times where everything just doesn't work out the way you want. One giant goal for this very unknown website might be to build a community where any student can go for any help they might need. Sometimes you just need somebody to relate with about different things. But anyway! Hope you like this little website I have made! :)</p>
     <p>A little extra fun fact about this page is the name of the website. Hestia is actually a greek godess that provide security for houses and homes. I just thought that sounded really nice and something I want this page to give as well! A page that makes you feel more secure in one way or another!</p>
